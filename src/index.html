          <h2>How Islands Form</h2>
          <h3>1. Volcanic Islands</h3>
          <p>
              These islands are created by volcanic activity, usually at tectonic plate boundaries or over hotspots.
              Magma from beneath the Earth's crust erupts and piles up until it breaks the surface of the ocean, forming land.
          </p>
      
          <h3>2. Continental Islands</h3>
          <p>
              These are parts of a continent that broke off due to tectonic activity, rising sea levels, or erosion.
              They rest on the continental shelf.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Greenland, New Guinea, Madagascar</p>
      
          <h3>3. Barrier Islands</h3>
          <p>
              These are long, narrow islands that form parallel to coastlines.
              They are built by the accumulation of sand deposited by ocean currents and waves.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Example:</strong> Outer Banks in North Carolina, USA</p>
      
          <h3>4. Coral Islands (Atolls)</h3>
          <p>
              Coral polyps build reefs around a volcanic island. Over time, the volcano erodes and sinks, leaving a ring-shaped coral reef around a lagoon.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Examples:</strong> The Maldives, Bikini Atoll</p>
      
          <h3>5. Artificial Islands</h3>
          <p>
              Built by humans, often by dredging sand or using concrete and stone.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Example:</strong> Palm Jumeirah in Dubai</p>
